                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Pinglabs is a small company that is trying to break into the performance management system space. It aims to be an alternative to current performance review systems by providing an easy way to get and view data on employees. Every week, Pinglabs sends an email to every employee at a partnered company that asks a question about teamwork, engagement, resources, or communication. Each employee answers on a 0-10 scale. At the start of every quarter, each employee is also sent via email a form to write about their three goals for the quarter, and then a 0-10 scale on which to rate how impactful those goals are to the company. Supervisors receive these forms, and send feedback on the goals while also rating how impactful they think the goals will be. At the end of the quarter, another form is sent out about how well the employee achieved their goals, to which the supervisor also sends feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>While Pinglabs customers are a fan of the questions Pinglabs sends out and the ease of responding to them by email, the current dashboard to view the data is poor. Matthew Cholerton, the owner of Pinglabs, describes the dashboard as “Unprofessional” in our first meeting with him. He also said that he was embarrassed to show potential clients the dashboard due to it’s quality. It was in dire need of a redesign.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>As a group, our goal was to create a professional, organized, and clean dashboard that Matt would be proud to show potential clients. We focused first on improving all aspects of the current dashboard before next adding new features to solve user’s needs that weren’t being met by the current dashboard.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            <h2>Research</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <br \>

                    <h3>Dashboard Design</h3>
                    <p>Since no one on our team had experience designing a dashboard, we all looked up best dashboard design practices. The best sources of data came from tableau, although we found some good information from other sources too. Some highlights of the research were to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put the most important view in the top and/or upper left</li>
                        <li>Limit the number of views</li>
                        <li>One color scheme</li>
                        <li>Select semantically meaningful colors if they apply to the context of your data</li>
                        <li>Mark label options</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                    <p>We next moved on to researching best practices for data visualization. We didn’t think all of the current pinglabs  Here are some of the facts we found most relevant to the types of data we were presenting:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For trends over time: Use a bar chart, line chart, or area chart.</li>
                        <li>For comparisons and rankings: A bar chart is the best choice.</li>
                        <li>For correlation: Try a scatter plot or a combo of two lines and a bar chart.</li>
                        <li>For distribution: Box plots and histograms are best.</li>
                        <li>For part to whole: Avoid pie charts; Use a bar chart instead.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Menu.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/MyStuff.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Redeem.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                    <p>We did ten 30-45 minute interviews with current pinglabs users. We wanted to find their problems with the current dashboard, what information on the dashboard was most important to them, what information the dashboard was missing, and what they wanted from their employees. We thought that by asking these types of questions we could find the underlying goals, pain points, and wants of the pinglabs customer for a new dashboard.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Interview Q's.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            </br >
                            <h2>Analysis</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div>  
                    </div>

                    <h3>Affinity diagrams</h3>
                    <p>From our user interviews, we created a large affinity diagram to get a sense of the trends in our user research:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Afinnity1.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Some of the biggest categories, in descending order, where:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I want happy and engaged employees</li>
                        <li>I want to see outliers/ red flags</li>
                        <li>I want a more intuitive/learnable dashboard</li>
                        <li>I want my employees to be independent</li>
                        <li>I want a summary along with insights on the data</li>
                        <li>I want to see trends</li>
                        <li>I want employees to work towards goals</li>
                    <ol>
                    <h3>Personas</h3>
                    <p>From our affinity diagram, we next moved on to creating persona’s. Our client wanted us to focus our design on mid range companies (250-750 people), but most of his current clients were much smaller (10-20 employees). We thus decided to create two persona’s, one for a mid size company manager, and the other for a manager at a small company. We had to make some assumptions about the large company manager as only two of the users we interviewed were at a company that size.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 ">
                            <img class="img-responsive center" src="img/Persona.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            </br >
                            <h2>Design</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div>  
                    </div>

                    <h3>Design Process</h3>
                    <p>For our design phase of the project, we tasked each person with coming up with multiple designs for different sections of the project. We then came back together and made group decisions about the best design for every part of the dashboard. I was tasked with designing the user interface, the outliers page, and the responses page.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds group.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        
                    </div>

                    <p>From there, we did a second iteration of design studio to flesh out those fifteen ideas. We each dug into our favorite ideas and tried to flesh them out.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds1.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds2.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds3.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Initial Design</h3>
                    <p>We then ended up deciding on three new ideas for the app:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We decided to add a personalization section that would allow users to choose categories of prizes that they wanted to receive.</li>
                        <li>We next decided to add a weekly games section that would let users play games on off days for extra entries into the weekly contest</li>
                        <li>We finally decided to add the ability to share prizes with friends instead of redeeming them.</li>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Design Goals</h3>
                    <p>We decided on these three ideas to solve both business and user goals. In adding features, we wanted to make sure that we kept the flow of getting prizes on tuesday easy. The app is meant to be easy and fun, and we wanted to keep true to that while improving the types of prizes the users receive and what they can do with those prizes. Our biggest concerns were to improve the user's experience without adding to many features or taking away from the simplicity and fun of the application </p>

                    <h3>Personalization</h3>
                    <p>One of the biggest pain points with the app was not enough offers that actually applied to our customers. Another was variety. Personalization can help with both of these problems. Personalization helps the user by giving them more offers that they actually want and also helps T-Mobile sell advertisers on partnering with them by giving them customer metrics. This should also help with the variety of offers that are offered. We initially decided to put a new section in the menu titled personalize to house this addition.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axurePers.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureGame.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Sharing Prizes</h3>
                    <p> We added the ability to share prizes. This allows our users to feel like they are putting more of the prizes they receive to use by sharing prizes they don’t want. It also would help spread the app to more users when prizes are shared with T-mobile users who don’t have the app. We decided to place this feature next to the redeem button because for business reasons, it made sense to have each prize to be used only once.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">

                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p> We added Games so that the users interacted with the app more, and got more free things, the main reason they come back to the app. Our research showed that users primarily only open the app on tuesday, and interact with the app for a very short amount of time. We think that by adding games, users will respond more positively to the app. This also allows for more promotion of the featured brand throughout the week, and opens the possibility for game sponsorship partners, or a new partner who offered a reward through the games. This feature was added as an extra item in the menu.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">

                    </div>

                    <h3>Layout</h3>
                    <p>We decided to change the look of the menu and mystuff page to fit in with our new personalize and games sections. Both of these sections made more sense in a tile layout to show off larger pictures, so we changed the mystuff and menu to a tile based look to keep the app's visual style consistent.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">

                    <h3>User Flow/Journey</h3>
                    <p> After deciding on these three features, we created a user flow and user journey that fit our persona’s and new features.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12">

                    <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
                    <p> We next created a paper prototype so that we could test and iterate.</p>
                    <div class="row">

                    </div>

                    <h3>Axure wireframes</h3>
                    <p> We next created a wireframe of our screens to test a higher fidelity product.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">

                    <h3>Axure Mockup</h3>
                    <p> We finally created a high fidelity mockup in axure after two rounds of Usability testing that I will detail in the next section.</p>

                            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div> 

                        <h3>Overview</h3> 
                        <p>For usability testing, we did 3 rounds of four gorilla tests. The first round on our paper prototype, the second on the pop app version of our paper prototype after a design iteration, and then a subsequent round on our high fidelity mockup in axure. For each test, we  asked the user tester to complete tasks associated with our user flows, and then asked them for their general thoughts on how usable the app was, why they had any issues (if any) using the app, and what their overall thoughts were.</p>

                        <h3>Round 1</h3>
                        <p>Initially, we decided to have personalize be it’s own section in the menu. Throughout our first round of testing, every user looked in the settings when prompted to personalize their prizes. We thus moved the personalization section from the main menu to the settings. This also caused us to redesign the look of the menu as there was now a visual imbalance.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-4 ">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/papermenuold.JPG" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-4">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/papermenunew.JPG" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-4">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Round 2</h3>
                        <p>The second round of user testing let us know that flow of playing a game from the normal app was confusing. After playing the game and winning one of the level of prizes, our users were hesitant to hit the button “go to my stuff”. After seeing a prize, they thought they might lose it by clicking on the button. We decided to change the button to read “add to my stuff”, which our user testers thought made much more sense.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/paperreward.JPG" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-4">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureAdd.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Round 3</h3>
                        <p>In the third round of user testing, we found that our users were confused by our personalization page. We decided to add a more accurate heading to give the users a better sense of what they were doing on that page. We also added a save button because the users were worried that hitting the X would cancel their changes.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">

                            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div> 

                        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                        <p>As a team, we worked really well together. We split the work up well, while making sure to always be on the same page about where each of us were. We were all very good at being respectful about each other's opinions while also quickly coming to group decisions. Whenever we disagreed, we would quickly come to a consensus. We were all good about not being married to our own designs and our own opinions.</p>

                        <h3>What I learned</h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li>This was my first axure project.  I learned that I need to plan my masters out before I start working. By not thinking about what items needed to be masters, I ended up having problems resizing the personalize page after we decided to add the save button and top message.</li>

                            <li>I learned that I need to become better at expressing my design beliefs. I didn’t think that our addition of games solved any of our user’s needs. None of our users expressed that they were anything but neutral towards the current games, and I believe that the reward (extra raffle ticket) would not be enough to make playing the games every week not feel like a chore. I don’t think I expressed my opinion in the most clear and concise way, and it’s something I want to work on in the future.</li>

                            <li>I learned a lot about how to express my needs as an introvert during this project. One of the group members is very extroverted, and I tried to always make it clear when I needed some time to think on my own, while always making sure to check in on regular intervals to share my work and get feedback about it.</li>
