                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>T­Mobile recently introduced weekly giveaways as part of its Uncarrier initiative. T­Mobile subscribers receive free gifts from the carrier and its promotional partners every Tuesday by using a dedicated “T­Mobile Tuesdays” mobile app. This program, along with other Uncarrier promotions, is generating increased subscriber growth and helping T­Mobile compete with the US’s two dominant carriers, AT&T and Verizon.</p>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>While the Uncarrier program has been an overall success, reviews of the T­Mobile Tuesday app have been mixed. Complaints include poor app usability and customer doubts about the value of engaging with the program. T­Mobile would also like to improve their promotional partners’ visibility in the app, to make participation in the program more appealing to new partners.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>As a group, our goal was to improve the app’s usability problems and to add features to solve user’s needs. We also wanted to never lose track of the business’s goals of brand loyalty, reliability, and ease of use. We aimed to be visionary in our design, and efficient in our process.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            <h2>Research</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <br \>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Domain Research</h3>
                    <p>To start, we did domain research. We learned that T-Mobile Tuesdays was created as part of the Uncarrier program to increase brand loyalty and resubscribe rate. We also learned about some of it’s early failures, the strategy of the Uncarrier program, and the target audience of the application. This gave us a greater understanding of the business goals for the app.</p>
                    
                    <h3> Application Audit</h3>
                    <p>Next, we did an audit of the current app. We went through the app multiple times, and documented the flow of the app through pictures to make sure each member of the team had a clear understanding of what was currently available and possible with the app.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Menu.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/MyStuff.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Redeem.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
                    <p>To finish our background research, we did a competitive/comparative analysis on the other carriers and a few other reward programs. This gave us a better understanding of the competition for T-Mobile and our app.</p>

                    <h3>Interviews</h3>
                    <p>After we had enough background research done on the app, we created an interview script, and then did 9 user interview’s. From the 9 interview’s, we created a document with snippets of the most interesting comments so that each team member could get a better sense of all of the interview answers.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Interview Q's.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            </br >
                            <h2>Analysis</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div>  
                    </div>

                    <h3>Affinity diagrams</h3>
                    <p>From our user interview, we immediately created Affinity Diagrams. From these, we learned that our users liked certain consistent giveaways, wanted variety, wanted personalized giveaways, and enjoyed the simple UI.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Afinnity1.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-6">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Affinity2.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Personas</h3>
                    <p>From our affinity diagrams and user research, we settled on two persona’s: one for our gen-x users, and our main persona for our millennials. Each represented the goals, behaviors, and pain points of their respective users.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 ">
                            <img class="img-responsive center" src="img/Persona.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
                            </br >
                            <h2>Design</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div>  
                    </div>

                    <h3>Design Studio</h3>
                    <p>To start our design process, we did a design studio to generate ideas that solved the pain points and goals of our personas. We then narrowed the ideas we created to our 15 favorites. </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds group.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        
                    </div>

                    <p>From there, we did a second iteration of design studio to flesh out those fifteen ideas. We each dug into our favorite ideas and tried to flesh them out.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds1.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds2.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ds3.JPG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Initial Design</h3>
                    <p>We then ended up deciding on three new ideas for the app:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We decided to add a personalization section that would allow users to choose categories of prizes that they wanted to receive.</li>
                        <li>We next decided to add a weekly games section that would let users play games on off days for extra entries into the weekly contest</li>
                        <li>We finally decided to add the ability to share prizes with friends instead of redeeming them.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Menu.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/MyStuff.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Redeem.PNG" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Design Goals</h3>
                    <p>We decided on these three ideas to solve both business and user goals. In adding features, we wanted to make sure that we kept the flow of getting prizes on tuesday easy. The app is meant to be easy and fun, and we wanted to keep true to that while improving the types of prizes the users receive and what they can do with those prizes. Our biggest concerns were to improve the user's experience without adding to many features or taking away from the simplicity and fun of the application </p>

                    <h3>Personalization</h3>
                    <p>One of the biggest pain points with the app was not enough offers that actually applied to our customers. Another was variety. Personalization can help with both of these problems. Personalization helps the user by giving them more offers that they actually want and also helps T-Mobile sell advertisers on partnering with them by giving them customer metrics. This should also help with the variety of offers that are offered. We initially decided to put a new section in the menu titled personalize to house this addition.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axurePers.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureGame.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Sharing Prizes</h3>
                    <p> We added the ability to share prizes. This allows our users to feel like they are putting more of the prizes they receive to use by sharing prizes they don’t want. It also would help spread the app to more users when prizes are shared with T-mobile users who don’t have the app. We decided to place this feature next to the redeem button because for business reasons, it made sense to have each prize to be used only once.</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureShare.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-4">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureTxt.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p> We added Games so that the users interacted with the app more, and got more free things, the main reason they come back to the app. Our research showed that users primarily only open the app on tuesday, and interact with the app for a very short amount of time. We think that by adding games, users will respond more positively to the app. This also allows for more promotion of the featured brand throughout the week, and opens the possibility for game sponsorship partners, or a new partner who offered a reward through the games. This feature was added as an extra item in the menu.</p>

                    <h3>Layout</h3>
                    <p>We decided to change the look of the menu and mystuff page to fit in with our new personalize and games sections. Both of these sections made more sense in a tile layout to show off larger pictures, so we changed the mystuff and menu to a tile based look to keep the app's visual style consistent.</p>

                    <h3>User Flow/Journey</h3>
                    <p> After deciding on these three features, we created a user flow and user journey that fit our persona’s and new features.</p>

                    <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
                    <p> We next created a paper prototype so that we could test and iterate.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Axure wireframes</h3>
                    <p> We next created a wireframe of our screens to test a higher fidelity product.</p>

                    <h3>Axure Mockup</h3>
                    <p> We finally created a high fidelity mockup in axure after two rounds of Usability testing that I will detail in the next section.</p>

                            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            </br >
                        </div> 

                        <h3>Overview</h3> 
                        <p>For usability testing, we did 3 rounds of four gorilla tests. The first round on our paper prototype, the second on the pop app version of our paper prototype after a design iteration, and then a subsequent round on our high fidelity mockup in axure. For each test, we  asked the user tester to complete tasks associated with our user flows, and then asked them for their general thoughts on how usable the app was, why they had any issues (if any) using the app, and what their overall thoughts were.</p>

                        <h3>Round 1</h3>
                        <p>Initially, we decided to have personalize be it’s own section in the menu. Throughout our first round of testing, every user looked in the settings when prompted to personalize their prizes. We thus moved the personalization section from the main menu to the settings. This also caused us to redesign the look of the menu as there was now a visual imbalance.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-4 ">
                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/papermenuold.JPG" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-4">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/papermenunew.JPG" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-4">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureMenu.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Round 2</h3>
                        <p>The second round of user testing let us know that flow of playing a game from the normal app was confusing. After playing the game and winning one of the level of prizes, our users were hesitant to hit the button “go to my stuff”. After seeing a prize, they thought they might lose it by clicking on the button. We decided to change the button to read “add to my stuff”, which our user testers thought made much more sense.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/paperreward.JPG" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-lg-4">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/axureAdd.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Round 3</h3>
                        <p>In the third round of user testing, we found that our users were confused by our personalization page. We decided to add a more accurate heading to give the users a better sense of what they were doing on that page. We also added a save button because the users were worried that hitting the X would cancel their changes.</p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">

                        </div> 

                        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                        <p>As a team, we worked really well together. We split the work up well, while making sure to always be on the same page about where each of us were. We were all very good at being respectful about each other's opinions while also quickly coming to group decisions. Whenever we disagreed, we would quickly come to a consensus. We were all good about not being married to our own designs and our own opinions.</p>

                        <h3>What I learned</h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li>This was my first axure project.  I learned that I need to plan my masters out before I start working. By not thinking about what items needed to be masters, I ended up having problems resizing the personalize page after we decided to add the save button and top message.</li>

                            <li>I learned that I need to become better at expressing my design beliefs. I didn’t think that our addition of games solved any of our user’s needs. None of our users expressed that they were anything but neutral towards the current games, and I believe that the reward (extra raffle ticket) would not be enough to make playing the games every week not feel like a chore. I don’t think I expressed my opinion in the most clear and concise way, and it’s something I want to work on in the future.</li>

                            <li>I learned a lot about how to express my needs as an introvert during this project. One of the group members is very extroverted, and I tried to always make it clear when I needed some time to think on my own, while always making sure to check in on regular intervals to share my work and get feedback about it.</li>
